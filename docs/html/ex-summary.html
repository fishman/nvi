<p align=center><b>Ex/Edit Command Summary (Version
2.0)</b></p>

<p><i><small><small>Ex</small></small></i>
<small><small>and <i>edit</i> are text editors, used for
creating and modifying files of text on the
<small>UNIX</small> computer system. <i>Edit</i> is a
variant of <i>ex</i> with features designed to make it less
complicated to learn and use. In terms of command syntax and
effect the editors are essentially identical, and this
command summary applies to both.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>The summary is meant as a quick reference
for users already acquainted with <i>edit</i> or <i>ex</i>.
Fuller explanations of the editors are available in the
documents <i>Edit: A Tutorial</i> (a self-teaching
introduction) and the <i>Ex Reference Manual</i> (the
comprehensive reference source for both <i>edit</i> and
<i>ex</i>). Both of these writeups are available in the
Computing Services Library.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>In the examples included with the summary,
commands and text entered by the user are printed in
<b>boldface</b> to distinguish them from responses printed
by the computer.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small><b>The Editor
Buffer</b></small></small></p>

<p><small><small>In order to perform its tasks the editor
sets aside a temporary work space, called a <i>buffer</i>,
separate from the user's permanent file. Before starting to
work on an existing file the editor makes a copy of it in
the buffer, leaving the original untouched. All editing
changes are made to the buffer copy, which must then be
written back to the permanent file in order to update the
old version. The buffer disappears at the end of the editing
session.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small><b>Editing: Command and Text Input
Modes</b></small></small></p>

<p><small><small>During an editing session there are two
usual modes of operation: <i>command</i> mode and <i>text
input</i> mode. (This disregards, for the moment,
<i>open</i> and <i>visual</i> modes, discussed below.) In
command mode, the editor issues a colon prompt (:) to show
that it is ready to accept and execute a command. In text
input mode, on the other hand, there is no prompt and the
editor merely accepts text to be added to the buffer. Text
input mode is initiated by the commands <i>append</i>,
<i>insert</i>, and <i>change</i>, and is terminated by
typing a period as the first and only character on a
line.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small><b>Line Numbers and Command
Syntax</b></small></small></p>

<p><small><small>The editor keeps track of lines of text in
the buffer by numbering them consecutively starting with 1
and renumbering as lines are added or deleted. At any given
time the editor is positioned at one of these lines; this
position is called the <i>current line</i>. Generally,
commands that change the contents of the buffer print the
new current line at the end of their
execution.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>Most commands can be preceded by one or
two line-number addresses which indicate the lines to be
affected. If one number is given the command operates on
that line only; if two, on an inclusive range of lines.
Commands that can take line-number prefixes also assume
default prefixes if none are given. The default assumed by
each command is designed to make it convenient to use in
many instances without any line-number prefix. For the most
part, a command used without a prefix operates on the
current line, though exceptions to this rule should be
noted. The <i>print</i> command by itself, for instance,
causes one line, the current line, to be printed at the
terminal.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>The summary shows the number of line
addresses that can be prefixed to each command as well as
the defaults assumed if they are omitted. For example,
<i>(.,.)</i> means that up to 2 line-numbers may be given,
and that if none is given the command operates on the
current line. (In the address prefix notation, ``.'' stands
for the current line and ``$'' stands for the last line of
the buffer.) If no such notation appears, no line-number
prefix may be used.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small>Some commands take trailing information;
only the more important instances of this are mentioned in
the summary.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small><b>Open and Visual
Modes</b></small></small></p>

<p><small><small>Besides command and text input modes,
<i>ex</i> and <i>edit</i> provide on some CRT terminals
other modes of editing, <i>open</i> and <i>visual</i>. In
these modes the cursor can be moved to individual words or
characters in a line. The commands then given are very
different from the standard editor commands; most do not
appear on the screen when typed. <i>An Introduction to
Display Editing with Vi</i> provides a full
discussion.</small></small></p>

<p><small><small><b>Special
Characters</b></small></small></p>

<p><small><small>Some characters take on special meanings
when used in context searches and in patterns given to the
<i>substitute</i> command. For <i>edit</i>, these are ``^''
and ``$'', meaning the beginning and end of a line,
respectively. <i>Ex</i> has the following additional special
characters:</small></small></p>

<p align=center><small><small><b>. &amp; * [ ]
~</b></small></small></p>

<p><small><small>To use one of the special characters as
its simple graphic representation rather than with its
special meaning, precede it by a backslash (). The backslash
always has a special meaning.</small></small></p>
